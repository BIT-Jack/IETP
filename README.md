# IETP
## Official codes the for paper: [An Ensemble Learning Framework for Trajectory Prediction in Interactive Scenarios](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9827070)
These codes are official codes for paper An Ensemble Learning Framework for Trajectory Prediction in Interactive Scenarios, Zirui Li, Yunlong Lin et al., Beijing Institute of Technology. The framework in this paper is termed Interactive Ensemble Trajectory Predictor (IETP).



We provides codes of our experiments in the paper. It is an example of IETP which uses CSP models as base learners.
The experiments in the paper are based on NGSIM datasets.

If you want to run the codes, please download the NGSIM datasets and create suitable directories in your own file folders. The data-processing in this case is the same as it in  the paper: convolutional social pooling for vehicle trajectory prediction.
